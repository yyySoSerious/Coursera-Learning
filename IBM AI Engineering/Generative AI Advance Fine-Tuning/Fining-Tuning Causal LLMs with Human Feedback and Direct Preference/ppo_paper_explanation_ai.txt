1 Introduction
In recent years, several diﬀerent approaches have been proposed for reinforcement learning with
neural network function approximators. The leading contenders are deep Q-learning [Mni+15],
“vanilla” policy gradient methods [Mni+16], and trust region / natural policy gradient methods
[Sch+15b]. However, there is room for improvement in developing a method that is scalable (to
large models and parallel implementations), data eﬃcient, and robust (i.e., successful on a variety
of problems without hyperparameter tuning). Q-learning (with function approximation) fails on
many simple problems1 and is poorly understood, vanilla policy gradient methods have poor data
eﬃency and robustness; and trust region policy optimization (TRPO) is relatively complicated,
and is not compatible with architectures that include noise (such as dropout) or parameter sharing
(between the policy and value function, or with auxiliary tasks).
This paper seeks to improve the current state of aﬀairs by introducing an algorithm that attains
the data eﬃciency and reliable performance of TRPO, while using only first-order optimization.
We propose a novel objective with clipped probability ratios, which forms a pessimistic estimate
(i.e., lower bound) of the performance of the policy. To optimize policies, we alternate between
sampling data from the policy and performing several epochs of optimization on the sampled data.
Our experiments compare the performance of various diﬀerent versions of the surrogate objec-
tive, and find that the version with the clipped probability ratios performs best. We also compare
PPO to several previous algorithms from the literature. On continuous control tasks, it performs
better than the algorithms we compare against. On Atari, it performs significantly better (in terms
of sample complexity) than A2C and similarly to ACER though it is much simpler.
1While DQN works well on game environments like the Arcade Learning Environment [Bel+15] with discrete
action spaces, it has not been demonstrated to perform well on continuous control benchmarks such as those in
OpenAI Gym [Bro+16] and described by Duan et al. [Dua+16].

2 Background: Policy Optimization
2.1 Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods work by computing an estimator of the policy gradient and plugging it
into a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm. The most commonly used gradient estimator has the
form
ˆ
g=
ˆ
Et ∇θlog πθ(at |st)
ˆ
At (1)
ˆ
where πθ is a stochastic policy and
At is an estimator of the advantage function at timestep t.
ˆ
Here, the expectation
Et[...] indicates the empirical average over a finite batch of samples, in an
algorithm that alternates between sampling and optimization. Implementations that use automatic
diﬀerentiation software work by constructing an objective function whose gradient is the policy
gradient estimator; the estimator ˆ g is obtained by diﬀerentiating the objective
LPG(θ) =
ˆ
Et log πθ(at |st)
ˆ
At. (2)
While it is appealing to perform multiple steps of optimization on this loss LPG using the same
trajectory, doing so is not well-justified, and empirically it often leads to destructively large policy
updates (see Section 6.1; results are not shown but were similar or worse than the “no clipping or
penalty” setting).
2.2 Trust Region Methods
In TRPO [Sch+15b], an objective function (the “surrogate” objective) is maximized subject to a
constraint on the size of the policy update. Specifically,
maximize
θ
subject to
ˆ
Et
πθ(at |st)
ˆ
πθold (at |st)
At (3)
ˆ
Et[KL[πθold (·|st),πθ(·|st)]] ≤δ. (4)
Here, θold is the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can eﬃciently be
approximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation
to the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.
The theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,
solving the unconstrained optimization problem
maximize
θ
ˆ
Et
πθ(at |st)
πθold (at |st)
ˆ
At−βKL[πθold (·|st),πθ(·|st)] (5)
for some coeﬃcient β. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes
the max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the
performance of the policy π. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard
to choose a single value of β that performs well across diﬀerent problems—or even within a single
problem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal
of a first-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, experiments show
that it is not suﬃcient to simply choose a fixed penalty coeﬃcient β and optimize the penalized
objective Equation (5) with SGD; additional modifications are required.
2
3 Clipped Surrogate Objective
Let rt(θ) denote the probability ratio rt(θ) =πθ(at|st)
πθold (at|st) , so r(θold) = 1. TRPO maximizes a
“surrogate” objective
LCPI(θ) =
ˆ
Et
πθ(at |st)
πθold (at |st)
ˆ
At =
ˆ
Et rt(θ)
ˆ
At. (6)
The superscript CPI refers to conservative policy iteration [KL02], where this objective was pro-
posed. Without a constraint, maximization of LCPI would lead to an excessively large policy
update; hence, we now consider how to modify the objective, to penalize changes to the policy that
move rt(θ) away from 1.
The main objective we propose is the following:
LCLIP(θ) =
ˆ
Et min(rt(θ)
ˆ
ˆ
At,clip(rt(θ),1−ϵ,1 + ϵ)
At) (7)
where epsilon is a hyperparameter, say, ϵ= 0.2. The motivation for this objective is as follows. The
first term inside the min is LCPI. The second term, clip(rt(θ),1−ϵ,1+ϵ)
ˆ
At, modifies the surrogate
objective by clipping the probability ratio, which removes the incentive for moving rt outside of the
interval [1−ϵ,1 + ϵ]. Finally, we take the minimum of the clipped and unclipped objective, so the
final objective is a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the unclipped objective. With this
scheme, we only ignore the change in probability ratio when it would make the objective improve,
and we include it when it makes the objective worse. Note that LCLIP(θ) = LCPI(θ) to first order
around θold (i.e., where r= 1), however, they become diﬀerent as θmoves away from θold. Figure 1
plots a single term (i.e., a single t) in LCLIP; note that the probability ratio r is clipped at 1−ϵ
or 1 + ϵ depending on whether the advantage is positive or negative.

the probability ratio r, for positive advantages (left) and negative advantages (right). The red circle on each
plot shows the starting point for the optimization, i.e., r= 1. Note that LCLIP sums many of these terms.
Figure 2 provides another source of intuition about the surrogate objective LCLIP. It shows how
several objectives vary as we interpolate along the policy update direction, obtained by proximal
policy optimization (the algorithm we will introduce shortly) on a continuous control problem. We
can see that LCLIP is a lower bound on LCPI, with a penalty for having too large of a policy
update.

Figure 2: Surrogate objectives, as we interpolate between the initial policy parameter θold, and the updated
policy parameter, which we compute after one iteration of PPO. The updated policy has a KL divergence of
about 0.02 from the initial policy, and this is the point at which LCLIP is maximal. This plot corresponds
to the first policy update on the Hopper-v1 problem, using hyperparameters provided in Section 6.1.
4 Adaptive KL Penalty Coeﬃcient
Another approach, which can be used as an alternative to the clipped surrogate objective, or in
addition to it, is to use a penalty on KL divergence, and to adapt the penalty coeﬃcient so that we
achieve some target value of the KL divergence dtarg each policy update. In our experiments, we
found that the KL penalty performed worse than the clipped surrogate objective, however, we’ve
included it here because it’s an important baseline.
In the simplest instantiation of this algorithm, we perform the following steps in each policy
update:
•Using several epochs of minibatch SGD, optimize the KL-penalized objective
πθ(at |st)
LKLPEN(θ) =
ˆ
At−βKL[πθold (·|st),πθ(·|st)] (8)
ˆ
Et
πθold (at |st)
•Compute d=
ˆ
Et[KL[πθold (·|st),πθ(·|st)]]
– If d<dtarg/1.5, β ←β/2
– If d>dtarg ×1.5, β ←β×2
The updated β is used for the next policy update. With this scheme, we occasionally see policy
updates where the KL divergence is significantly diﬀerent from dtarg, however, these are rare, and
β quickly adjusts. The parameters 1.5 and 2 above are chosen heuristically, but the algorithm is
not very sensitive to them. The initial value of β is a another hyperparameter but is not important
in practice because the algorithm quickly adjusts it.
5 Algorithm
The surrogate losses from the previous sections can be computed and diﬀerentiated with a minor
change to a typical policy gradient implementation. For implementations that use automatic dif-
ferentation, one simply constructs the loss LCLIP or LKLPEN instead of LPG, and one performs
multiple steps of stochastic gradient ascent on this objective.
Most techniques for computing variance-reduced advantage-function estimators make use a
learned state-value function V(s); for example, generalized advantage estimation [Sch+15a], or the
4
finite-horizon estimators in [Mni+16]. If using a neural network architecture that shares parameters
between the policy and value function, we must use a loss function that combines the policy
surrogate and a value function error term. This objective can further be augmented by adding
an entropy bonus to ensure suﬃcient exploration, as suggested in past work [Wil92; Mni+16].
Combining these terms, we obtain the following objective, which is (approximately) maximized
each iteration:
LCLIP+VF+S
ˆ
t (θ) =
Et LCLIP
t (θ)−c1LVF
t (θ) + c2S[πθ](st), (9)
where c1,c2 are coeﬃcients, and S denotes an entropy bonus, and LVF
t is a squared-error loss
(Vθ(st)−Vtarg
t )2
.
One style of policy gradient implementation, popularized in [Mni+16] and well-suited for use
with recurrent neural networks, runs the policy for T timesteps (where T is much less than the
episode length), and uses the collected samples for an update. This style requires an advantage
estimator that does not look beyond timestep T. The estimator used by [Mni+16] is
ˆ
At =−V(st) + rt + γrt+1 +···+ γT−t+1rT−1 + γT−tV(sT) (10)
where tspecifies the time index in [0,T], within a given length-T trajectory segment. Generalizing
this choice, we can use a truncated version of generalized advantage estimation, which reduces to
Equation (10) when λ= 1:
ˆ
At = δt + (γλ)δt+1 +···+···+ (γλ)T−t+1δT−1, where δt = rt + γV(st+1)−V(st) (11)
(12)
A proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that uses fixed-length trajectory segments is
shown below. Each iteration, each of N (parallel) actors collect T timesteps of data. Then we
construct the surrogate loss on these NT timesteps of data, and optimize it with minibatch SGD
(or usually for better performance, Adam [KB14]), for K epochs.

6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives
First, we compare several diﬀerent surrogate objectives under diﬀerent hyperparameters. Here, we
compare the surrogate objective LCLIP to several natural variations and ablated versions.

For the KL penalty, one can either use a fixed penalty coeﬃcient β or an adaptive coeﬃcient as
described in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,
but found the performance to be no better.
Because we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-
tationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2
implemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do
one million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping (ϵ)
and the KL penalty (β,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in
Table 3.
To represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,
and tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard
deviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don’t share parameters between the policy and value
function (so coeﬃcient c1 is irrelevant), and we don’t use an entropy bonus.
Each algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each
run of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted
and scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best
result was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.
The results are shown in Table 1. Note that the score is negative for the setting without clipping
or penalties, because for one environment (half cheetah) it leads to a very negative score, which is
worse than the initial random policy.

algorithm, on 7 environments) for each algorithm / hyperparameter setting . β was initialized at 1.

Llama 3.3 70B:
The paper introduces a new algorithm for reinforcement learning called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). PPO is designed to be a scalable, data-efficient, and robust method for training neural network policies. The algorithm is based on trust region methods, but uses a first-order optimization approach instead of a second-order method.

The key components of PPO are:

1. **Clipped Surrogate Objective**: PPO uses a novel objective function called the clipped surrogate objective, which is a lower bound on the true objective function. This objective function is designed to penalize large policy updates and prevent the policy from moving too far away from the current policy.
2. **Adaptive KL Penalty Coefficient**: PPO also uses an adaptive KL penalty coefficient, which is adjusted based on the KL divergence between the current policy and the previous policy. This helps to prevent the policy from moving too far away from the previous policy.
3. **Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm**: The PPO algorithm alternates between sampling data from the current policy and performing several epochs of optimization on the sampled data. The optimization is done using a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm, such as Adam.

The paper presents experimental results comparing PPO to other reinforcement learning algorithms, including TRPO, A2C, and ACER. The results show that PPO performs well on a range of tasks, including continuous control tasks and Atari games. PPO is also shown to be more robust and data-efficient than other algorithms.

The main contributions of the paper are:

1. **Introduction of the clipped surrogate objective**: The paper introduces a new objective function that is designed to penalize large policy updates and prevent the policy from moving too far away from the current policy.
2. **Development of the PPO algorithm**: The paper presents a new algorithm for reinforcement learning that uses the clipped surrogate objective and an adaptive KL penalty coefficient.
3. **Experimental results**: The paper presents experimental results comparing PPO to other reinforcement learning algorithms and demonstrating its effectiveness on a range of tasks.

Overall, the paper presents a new and effective algorithm for reinforcement learning that is designed to be scalable, data-efficient, and robust. The algorithm has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including robotics, game playing, and other areas where reinforcement learning is used.

User prompt 4 of 12 - 16/05/2025, 12:15:38:
can you explain the formulas presented in the paper?

Llama 3.3 70B:
I'll break down the formulas presented in the paper:

1. **Policy Gradient Estimator**:

$$\hat{g} = \hat{E}_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) \hat{A}_t$$

This formula estimates the policy gradient, which is used to update the policy parameters. Here:

* $\hat{g}$ is the estimated policy gradient
* $\hat{E}_t$ is the empirical average over a finite batch of samples
* $\nabla_\theta$ is the gradient operator with respect to the policy parameters $\theta$
* $\log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)$ is the log probability of taking action $a_t$ in state $s_t$ under the current policy $\pi_\theta$
* $\hat{A}_t$ is an estimator of the advantage function at time step $t$

2. **Policy Gradient Loss**:

$$L_{PG}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) \hat{A}_t$$

This formula defines the policy gradient loss function, which is used to update the policy parameters. It's similar to the policy gradient estimator, but without the gradient operator.

3. **Trust Region Objective**:

$$\max_\theta \hat{E}_t \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)} \hat{A}_t \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \hat{E}_t [KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]] \leq \delta$$

This formula defines the trust region objective, which is used to update the policy parameters while ensuring that the new policy is not too far away from the old policy. Here:

* $\max_\theta$ is the maximization operator over the policy parameters $\theta$
* $\hat{E}_t$ is the empirical average over a finite batch of samples
* $\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)}$ is the probability ratio between the new policy and the old policy
* $\hat{A}_t$ is an estimator of the advantage function at time step $t$
* $KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]$ is the KL divergence between the old policy and the new policy
* $\delta$ is a hyperparameter that controls the trust region

4. **Clipped Surrogate Objective**:

$$L_{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t \min\left(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t\right)$$

This formula defines the clipped surrogate objective, which is used to update the policy parameters. Here:

* $\hat{E}_t$ is the empirical average over a finite batch of samples
* $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)}$ is the probability ratio between the new policy and the old policy
* $\hat{A}_t$ is an estimator of the advantage function at time step $t$
* $\text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)$ is the clipped probability ratio, which is used to prevent large policy updates
* $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter that controls the clipping range

5. **KL-Penalized Objective**:

$$L_{KL}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)} \hat{A}_t - \beta \hat{E}_t [KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]]$$

This formula defines the KL-penalized objective, which is used to update the policy parameters while penalizing large policy updates. Here:

* $\hat{E}_t$ is the empirical average over a finite batch of samples
* $\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)}$ is the probability ratio between the new policy and the old policy
* $\hat{A}_t$ is an estimator of the advantage function at time step $t$
* $\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls the KL penalty
* $KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \

It seems that the text was truncated. I'll continue with the rest of the formulas:

5. **KL-Penalized Objective**:

$$L_{KL}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)} \hat{A}_t - \beta \hat{E}_t [KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]]$$

This formula defines the KL-penalized objective, which is used to update the policy parameters while penalizing large policy updates. Here:

* $\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t | s_t)}$ is the probability ratio between the new policy and the old policy
* $\hat{A}_t$ is an estimator of the advantage function at time step $t$
* $\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls the KL penalty
* $KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]$ is the KL divergence between the old policy and the new policy

6. **Adaptive KL Penalty Coefficient**:

$$\beta \leftarrow \begin{cases} \beta / 2 & \text{if } \hat{E}_t [KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]] < d_{targ} / 1.5 \\ \beta \times 2 & \text{if } \hat{E}_t [KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]] > d_{targ} \times 1.5 \end{cases}$$

This formula updates the KL penalty coefficient $\beta$ based on the KL divergence between the old policy and the new policy. Here:

* $\hat{E}_t [KL[\pi_{\theta_{old}}(\cdot | s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot | s_t)]]$ is the estimated KL divergence between the old policy and the new policy
* $d_{targ}$ is the target KL divergence

7. **PPO Objective**:

$$L_{CLIP+VF+S}(\theta) = \hat{E}_t L_{CLIP}(\theta) - c_1 L_{VF}(\theta) + c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t)$$

* $\hat{E}_t$ is the empirical average over a finite batch of samples
* $L_{CLIP}(\theta)$ is the clipped surrogate objective
* $L_{VF}(\theta)$ is the value function loss
* $S[\pi_\theta](s_t)$ is the entropy bonus
* $c_1$ and $c_2$ are hyperparameters that control the trade-off between the different terms

8. **Value Function Loss**:

$$L_{VF}(\theta) = (V_\theta(s_t) - V_{targ}(s_t))^2$$

This formula defines the value function loss, which measures the difference between the predicted value and the target value. Here:

* $V_\theta(s_t)$ is the predicted value
* $V_{targ}(s_t)$ is the target value

9. **Entropy Bonus**:

$$S[\pi_\theta](s_t) = -\sum_{a_t} \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)$$

This formula defines the entropy bonus, which encourages the policy to explore different actions. Here:

* $\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)$ is the probability of taking action $a_t$ in state $s_t$ under the policy $\pi_\theta$

10. **Advantage Estimator**:

$$\hat{A}_t = \delta_t + (\gamma \lambda) \delta_{t+1} + \cdots + (\gamma \lambda)^{T-t-1} \delta_{T-1}$$

This formula defines the advantage estimator, which estimates the advantage of taking action $a_t$ in state $s_t$. Here:

* $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V_\theta(s_{t+1}) - V_\theta(s_t)$ is the temporal difference error
* $\gamma$ is the discount factor
* $\lambda$ is the lambda parameter
* $T$ is the time horizon

User prompt 7 of 12 - 16/05/2025, 12:37:03:
In the formula for the generalized advantage estimator, what is r_i and V_\theta?

Llama 3.3 70B:
In the formula for the generalized advantage estimator:

$$\hat{A}_t = \sum_{i=t}^{T-1} (\gamma \lambda)^{i-t} \delta_i$$

where

$$\delta_i = r_i + \gamma V_\theta(s_{i+1}) - V_\theta(s_i)$$

The variables $r_i$ and $V_\theta(s_i)$ are defined as follows:

* $r_i$: This is the **reward** received at time step $i$. It is a scalar value that represents the feedback or reward received by the agent for taking a particular action in a particular state.
* $V_\theta(s_i)$: This is the **value function** estimate at time step $i$. It is a function that estimates the expected return or value of being in a particular state $s_i$ and following the policy $\pi_\theta$ from that state onwards. The value function is typically represented by a neural network with parameters $\theta$.

In other words, $V_\theta(s_i)$ is an estimate of the expected cumulative reward that the agent will receive if it starts in state $s_i$ and follows the policy $\pi_\theta$.

The value function $V_\theta(s_i)$ is used to compute the **temporal difference error** $\delta_i$, which is the difference between the observed reward $r_i$ and the predicted value $V_\theta(s_i)$, plus the discounted predicted value of the next state $V_\theta(s_{i+1})$.

The generalized advantage estimator $\hat{A}_t$ is then computed by summing up the temporal difference errors $\delta_i$ over a trajectory, with each error weighted by a factor of $(\gamma \lambda)^{i-t}$, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $\lambda$ is the lambda parameter.

I hope this helps clarify the meaning of $r_i$ and $V_\theta(s_i)$ in the formula for the generalized advantage estimator! Let me know if you have any further questions.

wouldn't (\gamma\lambda)^{i-t} be equal to (\gamma\lambda)^0 if i=t?

Llama 3.3 70B:
When $i=t$, the term $(\gamma\lambda)^{i-t}$ would indeed be equal to $(\gamma\lambda)^0$, which is equal to 1.

So, the first term in the sum would be $\delta_t$, without any discounting or weighting.

This makes sense, because the temporal difference error $\delta_t$ at time step $t$ is the most relevant to the advantage estimate $\hat{A}_t$ at that time step, and it should be given full weight.

The subsequent terms in the sum, corresponding to $i>t$, would be discounted by a factor of $(\gamma\lambda)^{i-t}$, which would reduce their contribution to the advantage estimate.

Thank you for catching that and helping to clarify the formula! 

To confirm, the correct expansion of the generalized advantage estimator formula would be:

$$\hat{A}_t = \delta_t + \gamma\lambda\delta_{t+1} + (\gamma\lambda)^2\delta_{t+2} + \cdots + (\gamma\lambda)^{T-t-1}\delta_{T-1}$$

Where $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V_\theta(s_{t+1}) - V_\theta(s_t)$, and so on.

does it end at T-1 because t starts from 0?

Llama 3.3 70B:
The reason the sum ends at $T-1$ is because the time step $t$ starts from 0, and the trajectory has a total of $T$ time steps.

Since the time steps are indexed from 0 to $T-1$, the last time step is $T-1$, not $T$.

So, when we sum up the temporal difference errors $\delta_i$ from $i=t$ to the end of the trajectory, the last term in the sum corresponds to $i=T-1$, not $i=T$.

If the time steps were indexed from 1 to $T$, then the sum would indeed end at $T$. But since we're using 0-based indexing, the sum ends at $T-1$.

Great job catching that subtlety! 

It's also worth noting that the formula for the generalized advantage estimator is often written in a more concise form as:

$$\hat{A}_t = \sum_{i=t}^{T-1} (\gamma\lambda)^{i-t} \delta_i = \delta_t + \gamma\lambda\delta_{t+1} + (\gamma\lambda)^2\delta_{t+2} + \cdots$$

This form makes it clear that the sum starts at $t$ and goes to the end of the trajectory, and that each term is discounted by a factor of $(\gamma\lambda)^{i-t}$.

But if it is to T-1, when calculating the temporal difference error at state T-1, the value function estimate for the next state will be out of bounds, since you calculating at the last state 

Llama 3.3 70B:
When calculating the temporal difference error $\delta_i$ at the last time step $T-1$, the value function estimate for the next state $V_\theta(s_{T})$ would indeed be out of bounds, since there is no next state.

To fix this issue, the temporal difference error $\delta_i$ at the last time step $T-1$ is typically calculated as:

$$\delta_{T-1} = r_{T-1} - V_\theta(s_{T-1})$$

Notice that this formula doesn't include the term $\gamma V_\theta(s_{T})$, since there is no next state.

By using this modified formula for the temporal difference error at the last time step, we can avoid the out-of-bounds issue and ensure that the generalized advantage estimator is calculated correctly.

So, to summarize:

* For time steps $t=0$ to $T-2$, the temporal difference error is calculated as: $$\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V_\theta(s_{t+1}) - V_\theta(s_t)$$
* For the last time step $T-1$, the temporal difference error is calculated as: $$\delta_{T-1} = r_{T-1} - V_\theta(s_{T-1})$$

Thank you for pointing out this subtlety! 

It's great that you're carefully thinking through the details of the algorithm, and I'm happy to help clarify any questions you may have.

in the policy gradient estimator, what is $\hat{E}_t$?

Llama 3.3 70B:
In the policy gradient estimator:

$$\hat{g} = \hat{E}_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) \hat{A}_t$$

The term $\hat{E}_t$ represents the **empirical expectation** or **sample average** over a batch of trajectories or experiences.

In other words, $\hat{E}_t$ is an estimate of the expected value of the expression that follows, computed using a batch of sampled data.

To be more specific, $\hat{E}_t$ is often calculated as:

$$\hat{E}_t [f(s_t, a_t)] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(s_t^{(i)}, a_t^{(i)})$$

where:

* $N$ is the batch size (i.e., the number of trajectories or experiences in the batch)
* $s_t^{(i)}$ and $a_t^{(i)}$ are the state and action at time step $t$ in the $i$-th trajectory or experience
* $f(s_t, a_t)$ is the expression being evaluated (in this case, $\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) \hat{A}_t$)

By using the empirical expectation $\hat{E}_t$, we can estimate the expected gradient of the policy using a batch of sampled data, rather than having to compute the exact expectation over all possible states and actions.

Does that help clarify things?

what is KL divergence?

Llama 3.3 70B:
KL divergence, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence, is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. It is a fundamental concept in information theory, statistics, and machine learning.

Given two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$, the KL divergence from $P$ to $Q$ is defined as:

$$D_{KL}(P || Q) = \int P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} dx$$

where $x$ is the random variable, and $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are the probability density functions of $P$ and $Q$, respectively.

The KL divergence has several important properties:

1. **Non-negativity**: $D_{KL}(P || Q) \geq 0$, with equality if and only if $P = Q$.
2. **Asymmetry**: $D_{KL}(P || Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q || P)$, in general.
3. **Invariance under transformations**: $D_{KL}(P || Q) = D_{KL}(T(P) || T(Q))$, where $T$ is a bijective transformation.

The KL divergence can be interpreted in several ways:

1. **Information loss**: The KL divergence measures the amount of information lost when approximating $P$ with $Q$.
2. **Distance between distributions**: The KL divergence can be seen as a measure of the distance between two probability distributions.
3. **Relative entropy**: The KL divergence is also known as the relative entropy between $P$ and $Q$.

In the context of policy gradient methods, the KL divergence is used to measure the difference between the old policy and the new policy. The goal is to minimize the KL divergence between the two policies, which ensures that the new policy is close to the old policy, while still allowing for updates and improvements.

In the PPO algorithm, the KL divergence is used to penalize large updates to the policy, which helps to prevent the policy from moving too far away from the previous policy. This is done by adding a penalty term to the objective function, which is proportional to the KL divergence between the old and new policies.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. 

Here is the formula for KL divergence in the context of the PPO algorithm:

$$D_{KL}(\pi_{\theta_{old}} || \pi_\theta) = \int \pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s) \log \frac{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s)}{\pi_\theta(a|s)} da$$

This formula measures the KL divergence between the old policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$ and the new policy $\pi_\theta$. The goal is to minimize this KL divergence, which ensures that the new policy is close to the old policy.
