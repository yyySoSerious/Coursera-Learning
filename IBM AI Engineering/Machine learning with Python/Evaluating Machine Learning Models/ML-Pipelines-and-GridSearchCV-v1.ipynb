A pipeline is essentially a sequence of data transformers that culminates with an optional final predictor. This structure enables seamless integration of preprocessing and predictive modeling, ensuring that the same data transformations applied during training are consistently applied to new data during prediction.\n","\n","Each intermediate step in a pipeline must be a transformer, meaning it should implement both fit and transform methods. The final step, which is typically a predictive model, or estimator, only requires a fit method. The entire pipeline can be trained simultaneously using a method like GridSearchCV, resulting in self-contained predictor that can be used to make predictions on unseen data.\n","\n","Importantly, the pipeline allows you to set the parameters of each of these steps using their names and parameter names connected by a double underscore `__`. For example, if a pipeline step is named `imputer` and you want to change its strategy, you can pass a parameter like `imputer__strategy='median'`. Additionally, steps can be entirely swapped out by assigning a different estimator or even bypassed by setting them to `'passthrough'` or `None`.\n","\n","A major advantage of using a pipeline is that it enables comprehensive cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for all steps simultaneously. By integrating the pipeline within GridSearchCV, you can fine-tune not only the model but also the preprocessing steps, leading to optimized overall performance. Pipelines are essential for scenarios where preprocessing involves estimators performing operations like scaling, encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and dimensionality reduction. Pipelines ensure these steps are reproducibly applied to both training and test data.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"479f320c-9439-4a80-8840-94f0d8f674b2","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["In this lab you will:\n","- Generate synthetic data for running targeted experiments using scikit-learn\n","- Train and evaluate a KNN classification model using a pipeline\n","- Tune model hyperparameters using a pipeline within a cross-validation grid search\n","- Build a more complex random forest classification pipeline using real-world data\n","- Extract the feature importances from the trained pipeline\n","\n","Your goal in this lab is to learn how to build and optimize a complex machine learning model using a pipeline and crossvalidation to tune its hyperparameters.\n","\n","The Practice Project, which follows next, is more hands-on.
