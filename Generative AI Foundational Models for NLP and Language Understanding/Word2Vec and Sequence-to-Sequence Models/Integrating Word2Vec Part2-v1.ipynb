It stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. Unlike word2vec, which is based on predicting context/target words, GloVe focuses on capturing the global word co-occurrence statistics from the entire corpus. It constructs a co-occurrence matrix that represents how often words appear together in the text. The matrix is then factorized to obtain the word embeddings. For example, if \"Man\" and \"King\" co-occure many times, their vectors will be simialr.\n","\n","The GloVe model follows a fundamental approach by constructing a large word-context co-occurrence matrix that contains pairs of (word, context). Each entry in this matrix represents the frequency of a word occurring within a given context, which can be a sequence of words. The objective of the model is to utilize matrix factorization techniques to approximate this co-occurrence matrix. The process is illustrated in the following diagram:\n","\n","1. Create a word-context co-occurrence matrix: The model begins by generating a matrix that captures the co-occurrence information of words and their surrounding contexts. Each element in the matrix represents how often a specific word and context pair co-occur in the training data.\n","\n","2. Apply matrix factorization: Next, the GloVe model applies matrix factorization methods to approximate the word-context co-occurrence matrix. The goal is to decompose the original matrix into lower-dimensional representations that capture the semantic relationships between words and contexts.\n","\n","3. Obtain word and context embeddings: By factorizing the co-occurrence matrix, the model obtains word and context embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations that encode the semantic meaning and relationships of words and contexts.\n","\n","To accomplish this, you can usually begin by initializing WF (Word-Feature matrix) and FC (Feature-Context matrix) with random weights.You will then perform a multiplication operation between these matrices to obtain WC' (an approximation of WC), and assess its similarity to WC. This process is repeated multiple times using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the error(WC'-WC).\n","\n","Once the training is complete, the resulting Word-Feature matrix (WF) provides you with word embeddings or vector representations for each word(the green vector in the diagram). The dimensionality of the embedding vectors can be predetermined by setting the value of F to a specific number of dimensions, allowing for a compact representation of the word semantics.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-AI0205EN-SkillsNetwork/matrix%20fact.png\" alt=\"Co-occurence matrix\" class=\"bg-primary\" width=\"600px\">\n","\n","The key advantage of GloVe is that it can incorporate both global statistics and local context information.

This approach leverages knowledge gleaned from one task, typically learned over massive datasets, and applies it to another, often more specialized task. The primary advantage of this is twofold: it bypasses the need for enormous computational resources to learn from scratch, and it injects a base layer of linguistic understanding into the model. By using embeddings that have already captured complex language patterns and associations, even models with limited exposure to domain-specific data can exhibit remarkably sophisticated behavior, making transfer learning a strategic shortcut to enhanced performance in NLP.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"670fb868-6699-4d34-b00e-363c4647e3b6","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["Let's take a look at the pretrained GloVe model from Stanford:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"98c5fec7-eda7-4228-95aa-4c75d116eb57","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["You can specify the model name and embedding dimension: GloVe(name='GloVe_model_name', dim=300)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"230d53fb-3850-42d2-91b1-1b69d3038e1f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# creating an instance of the 6B version of Glove() model\nglove_vectors_6B = GloVe(name ='6B') # you can specify the model with the following format: GloVe(name='840B', dim=300)"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"f32660fe-db0d-4ce0-81cd-6376e29c720b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# creating another instance of a bigger Glove() model\n#glove_vectors_840B = GloVe()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4998043a-06ab-453e-b5a1-1f2225c7f5a8","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["You must continue with the 6B model as it is lighter.
